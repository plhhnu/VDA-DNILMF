# VDA-DNILMF

2021-04-19


The R codes were used to predict virus-drug association (VDA) by the proposed dual-network integrated logistic matrix factorization. And the code is taken from Hao et al. [1]. 

How To Run:

(1) Install required packages

(2) setwd("dir including source codes")

(3) source("demo_VDA-DNILMF.R") ## vd data was used as an example.

These codes were tested on Windows 7, but should also work on Linux.

For any problem about these codes, please feel free to contact Xiongfei Tian at: txfhut@163.com.

If you want to see the original code, see [here](https://github.com/minghao2016/DNILMF).
